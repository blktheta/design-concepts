## Cohesion and coupling

Cohesion and copling are important metrics for software quality.

### Cohesion
What is cohesion?
- Cohesion determines to what degree an element of a function or class 
belong together.

A function/class with weak cohesion does a lot of things. While a 
function/class with strong cohesion has a clear responsability and only 
one task.

### Coupling
What is coupling?
- Coupling measures how dependent two parts of your code is to each other.

High coupling means that changing something in the program will result in 
mutliple changes in elsewhere. Code needs to be coupled in order to work 
together, however the more coupled the code is the harder it becomes to 
maintain because of the many interconnectet parts.
